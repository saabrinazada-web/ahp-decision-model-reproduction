# Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Decision Model Reproduction

## Project Overview

This repository presents a computational reproduction of an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) decision model for workplace selection.

The implementation translates manual pairwise comparison calculations into a structured and reproducible Python workflow. All priority weights, consistency validation metrics, and final rankings are generated programmatically.

The objective of this project is to ensure methodological transparency and analytical reproducibility.

## Methodological Framework

The implementation follows the classical AHP procedure:

1. Construction of pairwise comparison matrices
2. Column-wise matrix normalization
3. Priority vector estimation (eigenvector approximation)
4. Maximum eigenvalue (λ_max) calculation
5. Consistency Index (CI) computation
6. Consistency Ratio (CR) validation
7. Global priority synthesis across criteria

All matrices are validated to ensure the Consistency Ratio (CR) is below the acceptable threshold of 0.10.

## Criteria Evaluated

The model evaluates four primary criteria:

- Salary
- Career Growth
- Facilities
- Location

## Results Summary

### Criteria Weights

| Criterion       | Weight (%) |
|-----------------|------------|
| Career Growth   | 41.2%      |
| Salary          | 37.7%      |
| Facilities      | 13.8%      |
| Location        | 7.3%       |

Consistency Ratio (CR): **0.0581**  
The matrix is considered consistent (CR < 0.10).

## Final Ranking

| Rank | Alternative | Score (%) |
|------|------------|------------|
| 1    | PT. SAI    | 26.28      |
| 2    | PT. HWT    | 20.80      |
| 3    | WESTERN    | 19.87      |
| 4    | PT. JAI    | 18.47      |
| 5    | BPR        | 14.58      |

The ranking aligns with the analytical results generated by the model.

## Technical Structure

- `main.py` — full AHP execution workflow
- `config.py` — input configuration and pairwise matrices
- `requirements.txt` — dependency specification
- `.gitignore` — environment exclusion rules

---

## Reproducibility

To run the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
The output reproduces the priority weights, consistency validation metrics, and final ranking.

Implementation Notes
NumPy is used for matrix operations.

Tabulate is used for formatted command-line output.

The implementation is structured to ensure clean separation between configuration and computational logic.

This project demonstrates structured multi-criteria decision modeling with explicit consistency validation.
